# Hi there

Here you'll find starter kits for a bunch of different technology stacks to work with LicAuth ecosystem.

If you're a founder with a new idea and want to get up and going quickly, this is a great place to start. Conversely, if you already have a project underway, consider using one of the [LicAuth SDKs](https://licauth.com/oss).

All you need to do is:

1. Clone the repository for your technology stack of choice.
2. [Register a LicAuth account](https://licauth.com/register).
3. In your new project, put the credentials from your new LicAuth account in the `configuration` file.

Additional instruction exist in the repository's README, plus the [LicAuth Docs](https://docs.licauth.com).
